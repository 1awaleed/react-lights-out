<h1>Lights Out React game</h1>

<p>This is a simple interation react game based on two react components: Board.js & Cell.js</p>
<p>The game logic is developed by me but I used someone's css styling from <a href="https://codepen.io/">Codepen</a>. </p>

<p>to run from terminal: cd into REACT-LIGHTS-OUT folder then run: npm start</p>
